# F1 Prediction

This is a project to allow better predictions of Formula One (TM) Grands Prix.

## Background
Current sites just allow the input of predictions (winner, 2nd, 3rd, fastest
   lap etc.) and then award points for correctness. There is no supporting data
   and not much engagement, simply a prediction and a result.

## Project Aims
This project has several aims:
- [ ] Present FOM provided data from practice sessions
- [ ] Present weather data
- [ ] Allow predictions for strategy
- [ ] Allow pre-race predictions of results
- [ ] Allow in-race comparisons of reality to predictions
- [ ] Rank predictions, such that there are no 'tied' results

This should be about letting the fans be engineers.
